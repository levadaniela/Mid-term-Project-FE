# My Mentor Log

Group Project - Personal development application, built during a 1-week project in a team of 4 where users are able to keep track of mentor meetings using a custom-built notes application.

A full-stack app aimed to provide more structure to meetings between Bootcampers and their Mentors. My focus on this project was on front-end, creating specific sections for the app, providing a structure when planning a meeting. We constructed a clean and modern front- end using React and create-react-app, implementing modules such as Luxon to handle the date/time.

## Our brief
The brief we were given was to build an application which enhances the School of Code mentoring experience. Our user research found there is a lack of structure with regards to meteing with mentors, across multiple plaforms. A common problem was the inconsistency in organising meetings and a need for some more structure around the entire process, where all three parties (mentors, coaches and students) have more visibility.

## Our Solution
* Bootcamper journal to help the student to reflect on and articulate their SoC experience, so that they are able to have more meaningful discussions with their mentors.
* Give clear discussion points to help them evaluate how they are doing, so that they can get help and advice during their regular sessions.
* A place to keep track of meeting notes, goals, ideas and aspirations.
* Provides structure to the meetings with a clear agenda.
* Future ambition - Also to give the coaches visibility of if the meetings are taking place on a regular basis and how they are going.
